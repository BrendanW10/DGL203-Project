    </header>
        <h3>I'd like to do my website project on my personal website. </h3>
        <p>I have been spending the last week making high-end wireframes for my own personal website that id like to launch showcasing work that I have done.
            The website will consist of a header, about section, a services section, and a footer. The services section will showcase what I am able to do. like
            Graphic design, Web design, Video editing, and Branding. The website is my personal website for my own brand that im doing in hopes to be able to free lance.
            The company is called "2fifty". I already have a logo and colours planned for it.

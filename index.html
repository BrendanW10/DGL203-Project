      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>>I have always had a passion for graphic design. When I was 15
        I started to self teach myself how to use adobe photoshop. That 
        passion then built into video editing, and now has skyrocketed into 
        logo design and web design.</p>
      <p>I like to consider myself a jack of all trades. I have 9 year experience
        with photoshop, 9 year experience with video editing (2 years with 
        Adobe Premier), 2 years experience with adobe illustrator, and now
        after graduating North Island College with a diploma in Communications
        Designs. Website design.

      <h3>Straight Edge Mechanical</h3>
      <p>Straight Edge Mechanical is a company based out of Campbell River BC Canada. They focus on mechanic work on any type of equipment! They came to me 
        looking for a logo that incorperated a "wrench", and the colours "gold" and "burgundy". After a few days of back and forth we landed on this design!
        This design is exactly what they are looking for a gives the brand a mechanic look, with a nice fancy elagent vibe! Which will help it stand out next to its competitiors!

        <h1>DGL-203 Project Proposal</h1>
    </header>
        <h3>I'd like to do my website project on my personal website. </h3>
        <p>I have been spending the last week making high-end wireframes for my own personal website that id like to launch showcasing work that I have done.
            The website will consist of a header, about section, a services section, and a footer. The services section will showcase what I am able to do. like
            Graphic design, Web design, Video editing, and Branding. The website is my personal website for my own brand that im doing in hopes to be able to free lance.
            The company is called "2fifty". I already have a logo and colours planned for it. 
        </p>
        <h2>high-end wireframes</h2>
        <img src="../DGL203-Project/wireframes.png" alt="Website Wireframes">
        <p>The wireframe is not 100% done, But its getting close. I would also love to add a page called "gallery" Which would section off everything like the services
            section. This would be so I can show off the work I have done in a gallery format!
        </p>
        <h2>CSS features used</h2>
        <p>For this project there are a few CSS rules that I would like to use from this class. The gallery page id like to build with the grid format that we recently learned
            about. I'd love to be able to add some animation to the photo of myself when hovered over. As well as the three squares. I'd like them to move when hovered over.
            I would build the whole site using grid and flex where needed. I would use grid for the "Services" part of the website!
